* What is needed for implementing the next steps, such as signing transactions? Is your 
code and data ready for that? To sign transactions, you can use ARM hardware tokens or use hashed text keys provided by the software.

*How would you back up your private keys? For reliable backup, parallel servers can be used, which can be used in case of disruption.

*How should a teammate add support for a new coin to the API? I have written each part of the project as a separate program so that it can be easily available 
in case of team work or the need to edit a part of the program.
Just add the new part to the program.

*The format youâ€™ve chosen for inputs and outputs of the API! This program could be run on a variety of programming formats, 
but I always consider the fast and reliable way to run, that's why I used the web on Django.
